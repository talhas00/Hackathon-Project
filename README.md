**“Your Mind Friend” — A community health & mental well-being app for rural Bangladesh**  
Inspired by Hablu’s journey from campus chaos to corporate crusade 🌾💻  

---

## 🎯 Overview
**MonBondhu** (মনবন্ধু) is a **Figma-based design prototype** for a community health platform that helps rural Bangladeshis access **mental health support, preventive care, and local health services** — even when the internet doesn’t work.

It’s built from **Hablu’s point of view** — someone who grew up where maps fail, clinics are far, and help is usually just an uncle’s advice away.  
So MonBondhu doesn’t just inform — it **understands**, **simplifies**, and **speaks the user’s language**.

> 💬 *“People here don’t search by GPS — they search by memory, by stories, by landmarks.” — Hablu*

## 🧩 10 Design Missions

| # | Mission | Design Focus |
|---|----------|---------------|
| **1. Mental Health Check-In** | A warm, Bangla mood tracker (“মন খারাপ”, “ঠিক আছে”). Emoji-based, simple, private. |
| **2. Community Health Map** | Map + list hybrid. Uses **landmarks**, not GPS. Offline fallback. |
| **3. Anonymous Help Request** | Anonymous SOS form — no name, no shame. Culturally safe consent flow. |
| **4. Seasonal Health Tips** | Auto-switch tips for dengue, diarrhea, or heatwaves by season/month. |
| **5. Maternal & Child Tracker** | ANC + vaccination reminder cards aligned with EPI schedule. |
| **6. Symptom Awareness Guide** | Visual “When to Seek Help” cards — no diagnosis, just gentle education. |
| **7. Community Health Events** | Event cards for local health camps & drives with share + calendar icons. |
| **8. Volunteer Directory** | Verified CHWs and local helpers. Focus on faces, trust, and simplicity. |
| **9. NGO Data Export (for admins)** | Aggregated charts, no personal data. Visual insight only. |
| **10. Voice-First Assistant** | Bangla voice commands + text-to-speech for low-literacy users. |

## 💡 Design Principles

1. **Offline-first mindset:** Works visually without assuming internet or GPS.  
2. **Local language first:** All prompts and labels available in Bangla.  
3. **Empathy-driven UX:** Every screen asks “How would Hablu’s mother use this?”  
4. **Trust & privacy:** No forced logins, no personal data.  
5. **Simplicity > Innovation:** Because real usability is the real innovation.

## 🌙 Easter Egg

At **3:00 AM**, the prototype shows a message from Hablu:
> “Hey friend, it’s late. Sleep matters too. Tomorrow we build again.”
